**This extension adds the following functionality to youtube.com and m.youtube.com:**

- Audio only playback:
	- Works on Desktop and Mobile.
	- Works with the regular video player and the mini-player.
	- Save battery and bandwidth.
	- On desktop use the toggle in the lower right corner of the video player to enable audio-only playback.
	- On mobile use the semi-transparent floating button on the lower left part of the screen to enable audio-only playback, you can also "leave" the page and playback should continue normally.	
	- Seamlessly switch between audio-only and video playback using the toggle on desktop or button on mobile.

- Limitations:
	- Doesn't work with live content.
	- If autoplay is not enabled there may be some strange behavior.
