## firefox webextension
### **Tube Audio Options+**
### Manifest *v3*
**Small extension to add the following functionality to ${\color{red}youtube.com}$ and ${\color{red}m.youtube.com}$ video player:**

- Audio only playback:
	- Completely disables video rendering when the audio only toggle is enabled.
	- Switch between video and audio seamlessly.

- Limitations:
	- Doesn't work on live streams.
	- Depending on your network connection on some rare cases it may take a couple of seconds to get the audio-only stream.
	- Using the miniplayer may have unexpected results.  
Works best alongside an adblocker like ublock Origin.
