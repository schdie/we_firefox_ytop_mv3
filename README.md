### **Tube Audio Options+**
### Manifest *v3*
**Small extension to add the following functionality to wwww.youtube.com and m.youtube.com video player:**

- Audio only playback:
	- Completely disables video rendering when the audio only toggle is enabled.
	- Switch between video and audio seamlessly.
---
- Limitations:
	- Doesn't work on live streams.
	- Using the miniplayer may have unexpected results.
	- Sometimes YT gives an unsuitable audio source, refreshing the page should solve it.  

Used some code from from [here](https://github.com/craftwar/youtube-audio).  

The extension is heavily commented and was created for educational purposes only.
